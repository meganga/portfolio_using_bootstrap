### Sources
This project was given as a homework exercise in the coding boot-camp I attended:
https://www.freecodingbootcamp.org/.
 
 This project was possible because of the coaching I received from the boot-camp and  the courses I watched on the "Front-end Masters":
 https://frontendmasters.com/.
